                    <h3>Idea</h3>
                    <p>
                    The business idea is to establish a payment system that is going to make a simple, safe, fast, and secure payment system, through the use of QR Code.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    There are many other payment companies out there, trying to offer solution to this challenge, but what makes this a more unique approach is that the company would not only focus on payment system, but we also offered other services like logistic assistance and e-store that can enable merchants to carry out their businesses activities successful.
